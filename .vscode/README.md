# Python PowerShell Scripts for VS Code

Use these script to build and manage a Python Virtual Environment

# Setup Python Virtual Environment

At the root directory of the Python Module (where requirements.txt is located) run the following command in PowerShell.

```powershell
code_python
``` 

This will copy the .vscode directory under ` %userprofile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell` over to your current directory and run `build_env.ps1`.

Once the script has sucessfully completed the virtual environment is ready for use.
