# Introduction

This tool provides PowerShell functions that automate the workflow of setting
up and using a development environment.

- Create templates to perform operations like setting environment variables, IDE
workspace settings, etc.
- Create aliases specific to the project, handling routine operations
- Easily switch between development environments

The examples provided are geared to my work but will provide enough for you
to implement your own.

# Use Case

## Set up an environment

Instead of building a Python virtual environment and running pip commands to
install packages, this tool handles it in one command:

1. Clone down a repository
2. Launch Powershell and type `New-Code Python`. Give it a minute or two ‚òï

![code_python demonstration](./doc/code_python.gif)

The script automates the workflow of creating a Python virtual environment,
installing the requirements file via pip, setting up environmental variables,
and providing additional tools set up as aliases.

[Python Dev Env Template README](./DevEnv/.pcode_python/.pcode/README.md)

## Use an existing environment

Now that you have set up an environment, you can easily come back to it later on.

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Type `Enter-Code` and your environment is setup and ready to use
3. Type `Exit-Code` to tear down the environment, or simply leave the project
directory.

> Keep reading for information on how to automatically perform these
> operations simply by changing in and out of the project directory

## Change the Project prompt

The `.settings.json` file in `.pcode` that allows you to change the prompt of
the project. UTF8 encoding is supported, use Windows Terminal for characters
such as emojis to work.

```json
{
    "version": 1.0,
    "prompt": {
        "Object": "üêç ",
        "BackgroundColor": null,
        "ForegroundColor": null
    }
}
```

# Installation 

This module is available from the PowerShell Gallery, perform the following:

```
Install-Module DevEnv -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Setup Project Directory Tracking

Automatically enter your development environment when entering the
project directory.

![Enter-Code Added to profile](./doc/cd_project_tracking.gif)

Run the following in PowerShell to append the project detection code to the end of the profile.

```powershell
if (-not (test-path $profile)) {
    new-item -path $profile -itemtype file -force
}
Add-Content $profile @'
### DevEnv detect project directories ###
function global:_PWSH_ORIG_PROMPT {
    ""
}
$function:_PSWH_ORIG_PROMPT = $function:prompt
function global:prompt {
  if (Enter-Code -auto_entry) {
    return & $function:_DEVENV_PROMPT
  } else {
    return & $function:_PSWH_ORIG_PROMPT
  }
}
######
'@
```

# Create your templates

Use the `Set-Code` command to create your environment templates. If there
is an existing template under DevEnv under that name, it will be copied to
your template.

```
Set-Code python
explorer.exe (Get-Code python).FullName
```

# Environment File Structure

DevEnv calls scripts in the `.pcode` directory. Files prefixed with double
dots are executed when a function is called (ex: `Enter-Code`). Any `*.ps1`
files are set up as aliases, with the same name as the file, on project
entrance. Other file types and sub-directories are not used by DevEnv.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ.pcode    - DevEnv executes scripts under this directory
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ..enter.ps1   - Entrant Script (Enter-Code)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ..exit.ps1    - Exit Script (Exit-Code)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ..init.ps1    - Initialization Script (New-Code)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   clean.ps1     - Aliases
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   idle.ps1      *
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   lint.ps1      *
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄhelpers
‚îÇ           build_env.ps1
‚îÇ           info.py
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ.vscode
        settings.json

```

You can add additional files, which are copied over when creating a new
developer environment (`New-Code`), such as `.gitignore`. In the Python
template above, a `.vscode` directory provides additional for [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in the development environment.
